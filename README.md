### Last updated 09/13/2021 by Ekim Luo
Using longitudinal survey data, we examined whether White men perceived the risk of dying from COVID-19 to be lower than other demographic groups, including White women, non-White men and women. 

### Versions 
- Python 3.8.11
- R 3.6.1

## Description of data
- The [Understanding America Study (UAS)](https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php) launched a special COVID-19 survey between March 10, 2020 and July 21, 2021. There were a total of 29 waves with a two-week interval between waves. Wave 1 was a pilot and used different sampling methods and contained different variables, so for the purpose of this study, we excluded this wave. This means we analyzed data between April 1, 2020 and July 21, 2021 (28 waves total)
